## [1.6.2]
 - Configurable hud color
 - Improved minimap rendering (still experimental, don't use)

## [1.6.1]
 - Disable minimap by default
 - Add a warning saying minimap will cause crashes
 - Improve hud position on the screen

## [1.6.0]
 - Fixed minimap crashes-
 - Fixed minimap memory leaks
 - You can configure map though the UI now (click `M` or find it though ModMenu)
 - Simple HUD (not configurable yet)
 - Added clothconfig optional dependency (required to configure through UI)

## [1.5.0]
 - Added 1.19, 1.19.1, 1.19.2 port
 - Many technical changes so that mod is ready to quickly adapt to future minecraft updates
 - Greatly reduced background CPU usage
 - Support for Terralith, Nullscape, Incendium and many other mods that add non-vanilla biomes to the game
 - Improved rendering of infested, stripped and waxed blocks
 - Add config
 - Allow only Localhost connections by default (map won't be possible to access from your wifi unless you change this from settings)
 - Minimap position and internal http server is now configurable, check out minecraft/WhyMap/config.toml file and change whatever you need (more settings to come, they will be changeable from the UI in the future)

## [1.4.0]
 - Both 1.19.3 and 1.19.4 supported

 - If a mod or datapack you use adds non-vanilla blocks to the game, additional mappings will be created in minecraft/WhyMap/mappings-custom directory. If you use non-vanilla blocks and you want to share tiles with your friends, you'll need to share this custom mappings file as well.

Features

    Web frontend
    Display map at multiple zoom levels
    Display block textures when zoomed in
    Display shading and biome colors
    Display top of the nether roof with biome colors
    Separate map for every world and dimension
    Xaero waypoints importing
    Creating waypoints from web
    Sorting waypoints

    Centering on waypoints
    Showing player position
    Showing hover position
    Show right-clicked block data

KNOWN BUGS

    Error handling is not done. So if you for example upload faulty xaero waypoints file, you'll get no error message.
    If you click any waypoint or right-click on minimap, it causes something on the frontend to crash next time you zoom around. It'll cause zoomed-in tiles to not unload when you zoom out. And some waypoints may behave weirdly. Refresh the page if it happens.
    In some rare circumstances tiles can get corrupted
    Biomes are approximate

Current (temporary) limitations:

    Not tested for long distance travel (did fine for traveling like 20k away, both ways without huge memory usage)
    Not tested for using multiple accounts at the same time (you'll definitely be able to access only one from web, not sure about data corruption if you load the same region from both accounts)
    Most of the map won't update itself in real time. You need to reload the page (F5)
    Map doesn't save your view location when reloaded, it'll center on player again
    No proper error reporting
    Can't delete waypoints from map
    Can't browse not currently logged in worlds
    You can change waypoint color only though the waypoints.txt file in WhyMap folder
    No changable settings
    Birch leaves are tinted like regular leaves
    New waypoints are created at y60

NOT PLANNED features as of now:

    It can't find xaero waypoints itself, you need to import them from web
    No way to import xaero or voxel tiles
    Can't display map in game
